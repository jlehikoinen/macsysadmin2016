**Intro - horns**

```
And now the [G] marriage vow is very sacred
The man has put us together now
We ought to make it stick to- [C] -gether
Come on, come on, let's stick to- [G] -gether [Gsus] [G]
You know we [D] made a vow not to [D7] leave one another [G] never

But now you never miss your water till your well runs dry
Come on now baby give our love a try
And stick to- [C] -gether
Come on, come on, let's stick to- [G] -gether
You know we [D] made a vow not to [D7] leave one another [G] never
```

**Solo 1 - sax**

```
Well if you're [G] stuck for a while consider our child
How can it be happy without its ma and pa
Let's stick together
Come on, come on, let's stick together
You know we made a vow not to leave one another ever
```

**Solo 2 - sax & harmonica**

Horns continue after solo

```
Well if you're stuck for a while consider our child
How can it be happy without its ma and pa
Let's stick together
Come on, come on, let's stick together
You know we made a vow not to leave one another never
```
