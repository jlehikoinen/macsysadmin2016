## Prince (Radiohead): Creep

* Key: G
* Time signature 4/4, maybe 80 bpm?
* Chord progression: G - B - C - cmi
* Chords in double time compared to Radiohead Original
* Elongated intro so we can introduce ourselves

_...tonignt we're going to play melancholic songs for system administrators,
songs about work, the lack of appreciation, the lack of sex, just the whole
social awkwardness scene that we can all relate to..._

_...seriously though, there are a couple of happy songs in the set, but this
one is not it_

```
When you were here before [G] [B]
Couldn't look you in the [C] eye [cmi]
You're just like an [G] angel [B]
Your skin makes me [C] cry [cmi]

You float like a feather [G] [B]
In a beautiful [C] world [cmi]
I wish I was [G] special [B]
You're so very/fuckin' [C] special [cmi]

```

**That brutal guitar thing**

```
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul

I want you to notice (you want me to notice)
When I'm not around (when you're not around)
You're so fuckin' special (you wish  you were special)
I wish I was special (i think you are special)

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
```

**Epic guitar solo**

(no need for the prolongued screamy bits though)

```
She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run

Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
```

## Coldplay: Viva la Vida

* Key: D
* Chord progression: **G** - A - D - bmi (f#mi somewhere)
* Ac guitar intro emulates the keys

```
I used to [G] rule the [A] world
Seas would [D] rise when I gave the [bmi] word
Now in the morning I [G] sleep [A] alone
Sweep the [D] streets I used to [bmi] own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead long live the king
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh oh oh oh ohh oh [x5]

Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
```

Where's the solo?

```
Last night she said
Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turn 'round
Oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walkin' out that door

Well, I've been in town for just about fifteen minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walkin' for miles

See, people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turn 'round
"Oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah

Oh, people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
See, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turn 'round
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door, yeah
```

Insert solo and chord progression

## Green Day: Basket Case

* Vox: Miikkali
* Bass: Robin

```
Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Or am I just stoned

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining cause it's bringing her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
A ya-ya-ya

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Or am I just stoned?
```
