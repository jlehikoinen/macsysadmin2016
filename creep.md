# Creep (Prince version)

Prince plays the chords at "twice the speed" from the Radiohead version. With respect for the now dead midget of Love, i suggest we play [this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFXZNt4oLkE) :)

We could keep the original lyrics though. Prince swaps all yous for mes.

**Chord progression (transposed): `G` - `B` - `C` - `cmi`**

```
[G - B - C - cmi]

When you were here before [G] [B]
Couldn't look you in the [C] eye [cmi]
You're just like an [G] angel [B]
Your skin makes me [C] cry [cmi]

You float like a feather [G] [B]
In a beautiful [C] world [cmi]
I wish I was [G] special [B]
You're so very/fuckin' [C] special [cmi]

```

**That brutal guitar thing**

```
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul

I want you to notice (you want me to notice)
When I'm not around (when you're not around)
You're so fuckin' special (you wish  you were special)
I wish I was special (i think you are special)

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
```

Epic guitar solo

(no need for the prolongued screamy bits though)

```
She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run

Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
```
