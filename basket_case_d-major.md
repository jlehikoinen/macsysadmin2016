# Basket case (Green Day)


```
Do you have the time to listen to me whine	D  A  Bm  F#m
About nothing and everything all at once	G  D  A

I am one of those melodramatic fools		D  A  Bm  F#m
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it		G  D  A

*Ch:*
Sometimes I give myself the creeps			G  A  D
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me		G  A  D
It all keeps adding up						G  A
I think I'm cracking up						D  C  Bm
Am I just paranoid? 						G  A
Or am I just stoned?

D    A     G     A 	*2

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams				D  A  Bm  F#m
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down	G  D  A
I went to a whore, she said my life's a bore		D  A  Bm  F#m
And quit my whining cause it's bringing her down	G  D  A

*Ch*

D    A     G     A	*4

Grasping to control			G  A
So you better hold on

D   A   Bm   F#m   G   D   A	*2

*Ch*
